This is the template/reference file I originally prepared for a fast-paced
Python Crash Course which I first gave to students at Canada/USA Mathcamp 2013. I gave it again at Canada/USA Mathcamp 2014.

This was built with a mathy audience in mind, and with a goal of giving
them some basic python-bashing skills to help with Puzzle Hunt problems.

I hope to eventually build this into a more general workshop for a broader audience.

To note: a lot of the code here could be nitpicked in various ways, but I made some pretty intentional decisions based on the context of the workshop. There are thing which I intentionally excluded for the sake of not overloading students with too many rules or ways of doing things.

With this considered, I welcome feedback or suggestions.
